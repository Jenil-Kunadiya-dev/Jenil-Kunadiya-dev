👋 Hi, I’m @Jenil-Kunadiya-dev
👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly focusing on React.js and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), as well as design systems using tools like Figma.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, diving deeper into backend technologies like Node.js and Express.js, while also honing my skills in frontend design with Figma.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve building robust web applications, implementing design systems, and exploring innovative solutions.
